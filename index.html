        <h2> hello!!! My name is Sanchi Chaudhary, Today I am going to tell about my hobby which is playing outdoor games! </h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> I like to play outdoor games because  These games give us a chance to exercise our body, recreate our mind and also to get a breathe of fresh air.Outdoor games help children to develop important life skills. Children learn to communicate with people confidently. They develop a competitive spirit in them. They also develop a positive attitude.Outdoor play keeps kids active and can boost their physical stamina and fitness. Playing outdoor games can also strengthen their muscles and bones, build immunity, and lower the risk of many diseases like diabetes, heart problems, and obesity.</p>

      <h3>Importance of Outdoor Games
Outdoor games are definitely of great importance. Our brain gets tired after extreme studying in an approximate time of 45 minutes. When are brain is stressed, it canâ€™t take any more information and it gets distracted. This is why most of our classes in schools do not go beyond an hour. When we distract ourselves and go and play in the sun, our mind and body is refreshed and we are ready to take in more knowledge. This type of schedule helps us to relax as well as improve our health. It is also a great way to built and develop our personality. Team work is another important trait that you learn while playing amongst your friends. Co- operation and unity never becomes difficult for people who play in the sun often. We have a captain in charge for most of the games. This helps us to learn obedience and to abide by the rules.</h3>

        <h1> My Work</h1>
          <h3>A job, employment, work or occupation, is a person's role in society. More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment ("for a living"). Many people have multiple jobs (e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee). A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary (e.g., hourly odd jobs) to a lifetime (e.g., judges).

An activity that requires a person's mental or physical effort is work (as in "a day's work"). If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone's career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.</h3>
